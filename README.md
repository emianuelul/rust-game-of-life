# rust-game-of-life
Simple side-project I made to practice Rust.

# Things I leaned 
- How to use a 2D array (vector in my case)
- Type aliases

## How-To-Use
1. Run the application
2. Input a number for a file you're promted with
3. Input a symbol you want (must be a single character that's different from '.')
4. Input a number of generations you want the program to run
5. Witness life and death happen before your eyes!

## Create your own starter
You can create your own starting point, each file should __have at most__ 64 characters on one line and a maximum of 47 lines.

Live cells can be any character, dead cells are spaces.
